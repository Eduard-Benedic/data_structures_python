# Expressions, Operators and Precedence

**Expression** - contains values and operators
**Operators** - special symbols and keywords
**Compound expressions** - rely on the evaluation of multiple operations


## Logical operators
1. not
2. and
3. or
The **and** and **or** logical operators **short-circuit** - they do not evaluate the second operand if the result can be deducted from the value of the first operand.

## Equality operators
1. is  - same identity
2. is not - different identity
3. == - equivalent
4. != - not equivalent
**is** and **is not** are mainly used for detecting true aliasing.

## Comparion Operators
1. <
2. <=
3. >
4. >=
