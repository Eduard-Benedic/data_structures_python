# Recursion - achieves repetition
Recursions are used in:
1. The factorial function
2. Engsh ruler
3. Binary search
4. The file system



## The factorial functions
this func is known to equal the numbers of ways in which *n* distinct items can be arranged into a sequence
n! = 1 * 2 * 2 * 4 * ... * (n-2) * (n-1) * n

I can ilustrate the calls to a recursive function using a **recursion trace**.
In Python, each time a function (recursive or otherwise) is called, a structure known as **activation record** or **frame** is created to store information about the progress of that invocation of the function.
This activation record contains a namespace for storing the function call's parameters and local variables.



## Drawing an English Ruler
Fractal - a shape that has a self-recursive structure at various levels of magnification.

## Binary Search


# Multiple recursion
Process in which a function may make more than two recursive calls.
