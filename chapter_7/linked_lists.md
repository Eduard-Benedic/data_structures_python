# Linked Lists
Are a good choice because insertion and deletion is expensive at the front for a python list.


# Linked List
Made out of a sequence of **Nodes**
Each node has:
1. A reference to its object
2. One or more references to a neighboring node

# Singly Linked lists

Collection of nodes that form a linear sequence.
Each node holds.
1. reference to its representative object
2. a single reference to the next node

First and last node are called: **head** and **tail**

Going from node to node - **traversing**

Because the next reference of a node can be viewed as a **link** or **pointer** the process of traversing a list is aka **link hopping** or **pointer hopping**
