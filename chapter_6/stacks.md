# Stacks
A collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle
A stack is an ADT that supports 2 basic operations.
S.push(e)
S.pop()
Additionally.
S.top() - return a reference to the top element
S.is_empty()
len(S)

I can use a list to implement a stack but it doesn't conform with the typical nomenclature of a stack

# The Adapter Pattern
Can use a list in hand with this pattern
